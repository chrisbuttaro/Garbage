Garbage was an individual, event tracking, weekend project.  It was assigned in order to test our ability to create a full stack, Spring REST application where we model a simple Java object (POJO) to store in a SQL database.  In order to implement full CRUD operations on that object, we utilized restful annotations, sent, received, and parsed JSON objects, dynamically built HTML with those objects and JQuery, and utilized AJAX for asynchronous requests.
